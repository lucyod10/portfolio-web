          Hi! I’m Lucy Ogden-Doyle. I am a junior Web Developer who has recently made the switch from my career as an AR/VR Developer and 3D Artist. My journey took me from being a 3D artist who had an interest in all things computers, to learning C# in order to create my Virtual Reality projects. From here I began leaning into the development world by creating VR and AR experiences as well as mobile apps until I decided to make the switch into web where I am now studying to complete the transition into a full stack web dev :D. I am super excited about where my career takes me next and can’t wait to get started.
